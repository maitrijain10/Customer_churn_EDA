Customer Churn Analysis
Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis project!
This project dives into understanding why customers leave a service—focusing on contract types, payment methods, tenure, and demographics—to help businesses build stronger retention strategies.

## Objective
#### The main goal was to identify patterns and factors that influence customer churn. Specifically, I looked into:
- The impact of payment methods
- The role of contract types
- How tenure affects churn
- Patterns across age groups and service types

This kind of analysis is important for businesses to reduce churn and build long-term customer loyalty.

## What I Was Looking For
#### I was aiming to answer a few key questions:
- Are short-term customers more likely to leave?
- Does how a customer pays influence their decision to stay?
- Which customer groups need more focused retention strategies?

## Methodology
#### The analysis was performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Here’s a quick breakdown of what I did:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to reveal trends
- Percentage breakdowns to quantify churn across different segments
